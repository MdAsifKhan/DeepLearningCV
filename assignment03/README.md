# MLP using PyTorch

In this task we implement MLP using PyTorch. model.py implements a mlp model with CrossEntropy loss.


We use two different optimizers namely sgd and nesterov momentum. THere are four setup of experiments as follows:

1. MLP with SGD 
2. MLP with Nesterov
3. MLP with Nesterov, L2 regularization
4. MLP with Nesterov, L1 regularization
