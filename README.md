# DeepLearningCV: Deep Learning for Visual Recognition

This is a repository, under implementation as a part of Deep Learning for Visual Recognition course offered at University of Bonn. Here we implement different deep learning model and validate them for visual recognition task mainly object classification. ALl implementations are part of learning exercise and can be used by anyone else.

## Assignment Overview


* [Assignment 1:k-nearest neighbor and linear regression on MNIST](https://github.com/MdAsifKhan/DeepLearningCV/tree/master/assignment01)
	This assignment is a simple introduction to machine learning methods. We implement two algorithms k-nearest neighbor classifier and linear regression. For evaluation we use MNIST dataset.

* [Assignment 2: Will appear soon]
