# CNN for face classification

In this task we implement CNN to identify face images. We use ORL Database of
Faces for experiements.

Our implementation is as follows:

```model.py``` contains implementation of CNN and training and evaluating methods.


```utils.py``` basic utilities for visualization of images and filters


```run_cnn.py``` all tasks without dropout


```run_cnn_drop.py``` all tasks with dropout
